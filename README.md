# Poetry CLI Project Creator

The Poetry CLI Project Creator is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) tool for Python developers. It simplifies the process of setting up a new [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) project with customizable options.

## Features

- Creates a new Poetry project.
- Installs specified dependencies.
- Optionally creates a `.env` file.
- Optionally creates a `.gitignore` file.
- Optionally creates a `main.py` file.
- Optionally creates a `test_main.py` file.

## Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/embedhead-io/Poetry-CLI

This tool relies on Python 3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. If not, download it from the official Python website.

Usage

You can use the poetry.sh script to run the Poetry CLI Project Creator:

./poetry.sh

When you run the script, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the directory of your Poetry CLI script. If you leave this empty and press Enter, the script will use a default directory.

The CLI will then ask you a series of questions to customize your new Poetry project.
